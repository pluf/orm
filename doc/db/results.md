# Results

When query is executed by `Connection` or
[PDO](http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.query.php), it will return an object that
can stream results back to you. The PDO class execution produces you can iterate over.

If you are using a custom connection, you then will also need a custom object
for streaming results.
